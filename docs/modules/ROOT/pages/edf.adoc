.Overview
The files here are written to be completely platform independent that are useful in any embedded systems project. Within this collection of files are two main groups

. STL-Like Containers - Containers with a fixed max size that are statically allocated
. Miscellaneous - Classes that don't fit into another group
// . RTOS - Classes that only are useful when using an RTOS

== STL-Like Containers
. {ref_edf_array} - wrapper around regular array. Almost exactly the same as std::array
. {ref_edf_vector} - Array that can "grow" up to a maximum size
. {ref_edf_stack} - adapts EDF::Vector to turn it into an EDF::Stack
. {ref_edf_queue} - circular queue (AKA ring buffer) using an EDF::Array
. {ref_edf_heap} - min and max heap using an EDF::Vector

== Miscellaneous 
. {ref_edf_assert} - assert a condition is true, abort() if false
. {ref_edf_string} - Strings that can "grow" up to a maximum size
. {ref_edf_version} - String to semantic version for easy comparisons
. {ref_edf_math} - A collection of MISC common math functions
.. isPow2
.. min
.. max
.. voltageDividerCalcVin
.. voltageDividerCalcVout
.. nElements
. {ref_edf_bit_field} - Name one or more specific bits within an unsigned integer
. {ref_edf_color} - RGBA colors
. {ref_edf_unix_timestamp} - wrapper for <ctime>

// TODO: Should RTOS include things like a generic CLI implementation? Logger?
// == RTOS
// . {ref_edf_semaphore}
// . {ref_edf_mutex}
// . {ref_edf_event_group}
// . {ref_edf_lock}
// . {ref_edf_message_queue}
